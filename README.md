<p>so this story happened to annon and his brother they were young at the time and it was an cold winter their parents left them home alone because they were getting more food that would last the entire winter every news told the ppl to get food for the rest of the winter now annons family had plenty of food but they were not sure if it would last that long.
now annon amd his brother were up stairs and right close to them there was an door that leads to the attic that door was old so it made an huge creeking noise when it would get opend or closed now annon and his brother sleept to the room next to it even tho their parents told them to never enter the room at night  but annon being 16 and thinking he can beat everything that gets on his way decided they were sleeping on that room because it was the warmer room in the house but during day time it was so cold
now there is a story about this room now this house was about 50 year old now everyone who sleept here harmed their self.Annons little brother was scared to sleep here but he was forced to now they were left home alone for the weekend because their parents were told to stay in an hotel untill the the storm stoped now annon tried not to sleep and waited for his brother to sleep his brother said he would not sleep untill he went to his actual room so annon followed him to his actual room waited for him to fall asleep and went back to the room because he had already put his pc tv and xbox in that room plus he had an dvd player that was never touched but he had 5 boxes filled with DVD's so he got on a call with his friends and played some games on xbox then on pc and then he opend his camera and started one of the movies they decided to watch an horror movie.The movie started but it was not what they thought it was an video of just some text typing "check your door" after that they all heard an knock on a door but annon was sure it was coming from his house but who would knock on an door and how would they do that in the hard storm but then annon heard the attic door open and close he had his dads glock downstairs he went to grab it and went in the room with his brother to protect him.Now them and their neighbours were so close they went on the balcony and the neighbours said they would take care of them untill their parents came but it was dark at the time now annon sent his brother there first the snow was on annons knees he knew it was getting bad then he got his xbox pc and some food to their neighbours house before he went away he heard someo women scream and then the attic door shut so fast but so loud he got his glock out and shot the door a bunch of times every time he shot the screaming got louder the door started opening and closing with him being so scared the only way out was the balcony and he went for it but he landed on his head which lead him to his death then his brother told everyone about how he sleept into the room he was not supposed to stay at.The police investigated but found nothing the case was closed as a suicide.
